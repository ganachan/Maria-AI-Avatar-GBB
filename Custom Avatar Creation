## **Recording Environment**

##Get consent video: Obtain a video recording of the consent statement. The consent statement is a video recording of the avatar talent reading a statement, giving consent to the usage of their image and voice data to train a custom text to speech avatar model.
##training data: Ensure that the video recording is in the right format. It's a good idea to shoot the video recording in a professional-quality video shooting studio to get a clean background image. The quality of the resulting avatar heavily depends on the recorded video used for training. Factors like speaking rate, body posture, facial expression, hand gestures, consistency in the actor's position, and lighting of the video recording are essential to create an engaging custom text to speech avatar.
##Train the avatar model: We'll start training the custom text to speech model after verifying the consent statement of the avatar talent. This step is currently manually done by Microsoft. You'll be notified after the model is successfully trained.
##Deploy and use your avatar model in your APPs


### **Background Requirement**
- **Use a clean, smooth, and pure-colored background**, ideally a green screen.
- Ensure the background is well-lit and free from shadows.
- Keep the actor 0.5m - 1m away from the background to avoid shadows.

### **Lighting**
- Ensure even and bright lighting on the actor's face.
- Avoid shadows and reflections on the actor's face, glasses, and clothes.
- Use stable artificial light sources to avoid changes in ambient light.

### **Devices**
- **Camera**: Minimum 1080p resolution at 25 FPS.
- Ensure the camera and lighting position remains consistent during the entire shoot.
- A teleprompter can be used for scripts but should not distract the actor's gaze.

## **Appearance of the Actor**

### **Hair**
- Keep hair neat, smooth, and glossy.
- Ensure hair does not obscure the face or eyes.
- Avoid messy hair or hair that changes position too much during the recording.

### **Clothing**
- Avoid loose, heavy, or complex clothing that may impact consistency.
- Avoid reflective or translucent materials, and ensure the clothing contrasts with the background.

### **Face**
- Ensure the actor's face is clearly visible and free of obstructions like hair, sunglasses, or accessories.

## **What Video Clips to Record**

### **Status 0 Speaking**
- The actor maintains a natural posture while speaking for 3-5 minutes.
- Slight movements like head or shoulder shifts are allowed, but avoid excessive motion.

### **Naturally Speaking**
- The actor speaks with natural hand gestures, ensuring hands return to status 0 after gestures.
- Record a minimum of 5 minutes, up to 30 minutes in total.

### **Silent Status**
- The actor maintains status 0 without speaking for 1 minute, portraying a relaxed listening or waiting posture.

### **Gestures (Optional)**
- Gesture clips should be under 10 seconds, starting and ending in status 0.
- No more than 10 gestures per custom avatar model.

## **Data Requirements**
- Ensure consistent size, position, brightness, and contrast of the character during the video processing.
- Video files should be in .mp4 or .mov format.
- Keep the start and end of each clip in status 0, with the actor looking ahead, mouth closed, and smiling.

## **Next Steps**
After recording, ensure the video data is well-prepared and processed to meet the required data quality for model training. The final avatar will reflect the conditions of the training data, so maintaining consistency and quality during recording is crucial.
