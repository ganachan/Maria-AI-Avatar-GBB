## Key Points for Post-Video Collection Process

### Manual Training Process:
- After collecting video samples, the custom avatar undergoes a manual training process to create the text-to-speech model.
- You will be notified once the model training is successfully completed.

### Deploying the Custom Avatar:
- Before using the custom avatar, it must be deployed to an endpoint.
- You can create up to 10 custom avatar endpoints per standard (S0) Speech resource.

### Using the Deployed Avatar:
- The deployed avatar will appear in the avatar list within Speech Studio, under both text-to-speech and live chat avatars.
- You can also access the avatar via API by specifying the avatar model name.

### Steps to Add a Deployment Endpoint:
1. **Sign in to Speech Studio.**
2. **Navigate to Custom Avatar > Your Project Name > Train Model.**
3. **Select the trained model** you want to deploy.
4. **Click the "Deploy Model" button** to confirm and create the endpoint.
5. **Access the deployed avatar** in the Speech Studio portal for testing and video creation using text input.

### Utilizing the Deployed Avatar:
- Once deployed, you can use the avatar to create videos directly from the Speech Studio or through API integration.

### Check your avatar
- Once your model is successfully deployed as an endpoint, you can select the endpoint link on the Deploy model page. There, you'll find a link to the text to speech avatar portal on Speech Studio, where you can try and create videos with your custom avatar using text input.
